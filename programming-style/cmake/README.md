# Avantize CMake Coding Style Guide

Here is a guide describes the recommended coding style for CMake.

Please look through [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt).

Here are some rules we are sticking to.

1. All variable in uppercase format. For example:

   ``` cmake
   set(HEADERS ...)
   set(LIBRARY_PATH ...)
   ```

2. Use alphabetical order in lists. For example:
<p align="left"><img src="https://raw.github.com/SMelanko/AvantizeGuide/master/programming-style/cmake/imgs/img-1.png"/></p>
